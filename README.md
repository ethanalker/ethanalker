- I’m @ethanalker
- I program for fun, and I made a Github to share some of the programs I've made.
- I'm currently a senior in high school and looking into majoring in computer science or engineering.
- You can email me at ealker1@gmail.com if you have any questions about my projects or want to reach me for any other reason.
